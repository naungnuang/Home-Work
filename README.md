> Ayeyarwady river bisects Myanmar from north to south and empties through the nine-armed Irrawaddy Delta into the Indian Ocean.
> The Irrawaddy River arises by the confluence of the N'mai (Nam Gio) and Mali Rivers in Kachin State. Both the N'mai and Mali Rivers find their sources in the Himalayan glaciers of Upper Burma near 28Â° N. The eastern branch of the two, N'mai,[12] is the larger and rises in the Languela Glacier north of Putao.[13] It is unnavigable because of the strong current whereas the smaller western branch, the Mali river, is navigable, despite a few rapids. Herefore, the Mali river is still called by the same name as the main river by locals.[14] The controversial Myitsone Dam is currently under construction at the convergence of these rivers.
